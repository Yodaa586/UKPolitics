<!-- Description -->
<div class="p-t-b-15">
<p>House of commons and house of lords:<br> <br>
If we get elected we will change the amount of members of parliament we have from 650 to 420, this means that we will be reducing the amount of constituencies there are. 211 seats in the house of commons will be required for a majority. We will decrease the amount of people in the house of lords from 300 to 69. These changes will be made to help strengthen democracy in the United Kingdom. <br> <br> 
Economic policy: <br> <br> If you are homeless, get a house, very simple this is the reason why we would immediately abolish any schemes to help people to get houses, we will also not give you any houses or anything related even if you say you need it as you will be lying. Just buy a house. If you are in poverty, get a better job this is why we will stop any schemes to help people get food or anything else as if they need that they are just trying to be lazy. Any good banks or other charities which help people be lazy will immediately be made illegal and if one is discovered, the company or charity will have to pay 150% of their worth, if they do not comply the founders and the CEO will be chucked be in prison for life. All the workers have all their money and anything else they own taken off them and sold for money as they did not inform us that this illegal activity was going on. Although, every year we will take all the wealth from the richest 1% of people and take 90% of it to fund our government; we will then redistribute the other 10% to the top percent of people who read our manifestos the most amount of times. If you want to keep your wealth, you have to read this manifesto more times than 99 percent of the population. We will also restart the industrial revolution and make our Gross Domestic Product 5 times bigger within 4 years of being elected into office. We will attempt to make our Gross Domestic Product higher than China and the United States Of America within 24 years. We will restore the British Empire at the peak of its time within 12 years. We will restore the greatness of the British Empire and the british people will recieve great benefits.
  <br> <br> Healthcare Policy: <br> <br> We think that the United States healthcare system is going in the right direction, but we want to go further than it already is. Healthcare is a privilege, not a human right. Remember that. Back in the good old days people did not have all the modern medicine we have today, people just toughed illnesses out and people's immune systems were great. We will ban all antibiotics, care for the weak, or anything else that was not around in the 1700s. This will make the population left have stronger immune systems and they will be much healthier. Although, we will make a special exception for those who vote for us in the next General Election as you are the people we want in our country.
  <br> <br> Education policy: Childeren do not need education, they can work on potato farms. Once they have spent 10 years on a potato farm we will teach them basic maths, reading and writing for Â£75,000 a year of education at the parents/childs expense.
